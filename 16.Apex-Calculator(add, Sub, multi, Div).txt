 Apex & Platform Basics
Q: What is Salesforce.com?
A: Salesforce.com is a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform offering both SaaS and PaaS services. It provides tools to manage customer data, automate workflows, and build custom applications.

Q: What is Apex?
A: Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Salesforce for writing business logic, such as triggers, classes, and web services, that runs on the Force.com platform.

Q: Why do we use Apex in Salesforce?
A: Apex allows developers to implement custom logic directly in the Salesforce cloud. It is used for automation, customization, data manipulation, and extending platform functionalities.

Q: Is Apex compiled or interpreted?
A: Apex is compiled and executed entirely on Salesforce servers. The compilation happens when the code is saved.

Q: Where can we write Apex code in Salesforce?
A: In the Developer Console, Apex Class Editor, Visual Studio Code (with Salesforce CLI), or directly in the Setup UI under Apex Classes.

🔹 About the Code
Q: What does your code do?
A: It defines a class Calculator with static methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers provided by the user.

Q: What are static methods in Apex?
A: Static methods belong to the class itself, not to objects. They can be called directly using the class name without instantiating the class.

Q: Why are you using static methods here?
A: Since the operations are simple and don’t require maintaining object state, static methods provide a clean and efficient way to perform these tasks.

Q: What data types are used in the code?
A: We use Integer for input values and return types for add, subtract, multiply. For divide, we use Decimal to handle non-integer results accurately.

Q: Why use Decimal instead of Integer for division?
A: To avoid loss of precision. Integer division truncates decimals, whereas Decimal retains them (e.g., 7/2 returns 3 with Integer, but 3.5 with Decimal).

🔹 Method-Level Questions
Q: Explain the add() method.
A: It takes two integers as input and returns their sum. It uses the + operator.

Q: Explain the subtract() method.
A: It returns the difference between two integers using the - operator.

Q: Explain the multiply() method.
A: It multiplies two integers using the * operator.

Q: Explain the divide() method.
A: It divides two integers, first checking for zero division. If the divisor is not zero, it converts both to Decimal and returns the result of a / b.

Q: What happens if the user divides by 0?
A: The method detects division by zero, prints a debug message, and returns null instead of throwing an error.

🔹 Execution and Debugging
Q: How do you run this code in Salesforce?
A: By opening the Developer Console, selecting "Execute Anonymous", pasting the test code, and clicking Execute.

Q: What is System.debug()?
A: It logs the output to the Debug Logs tab in Developer Console, helping developers see variable values and program results.

Q: Why use Execute Anonymous?
A: It allows us to run Apex code directly for testing purposes without needing a user interface.

🔹 Salesforce Platform Concepts
Q: What is Force.com?
A: Force.com is Salesforce’s Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to build and run apps on Salesforce infrastructure using Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning.

Q: What are Governor Limits?
A: Salesforce enforces limits to ensure multi-tenant resource fairness, like limiting SOQL queries (100), DML operations (150), and CPU time (10,000 ms).

Q: Do these arithmetic methods hit governor limits?
A: No, they are simple CPU-bound operations with no DML or SOQL, so they stay well within limits.

Q: Can you call this class from a Lightning Web Component?
A: Yes. We can expose the Apex class methods as @AuraEnabled and use them in LWC or Aura components for UI interaction.

🔹 Error Handling and Security
Q: How does your code handle invalid input?
A: It includes a check to avoid division by zero. Further validation can be added if inputs come from a UI.

Q: Can you secure this code to prevent unauthorized access?
A: Yes, using with sharing keyword in the class ensures respect for object/field-level permissions.

Q: How would you store and retrieve input from Salesforce objects?
A: By defining a custom object with fields like Number1, Number2, Result, and using SOQL/DML in Apex.

🔹 Practical Application Questions
Q: What are some real-world uses of this logic?
A: It can be used in invoicing (total = qty × price), tax calculation, profit/loss analysis, student score aggregation, etc.

Q: How would you expose this logic to external systems?
A: By converting this class into a @RestResource API endpoint so other applications can send inputs and receive results.

Q: What is the difference between a trigger and a class?
A: A trigger automatically executes when a record is inserted/updated, while a class is reusable logic that can be called manually or from triggers.

Q: Can you schedule this logic to run automatically?
A: Yes, using Scheduled Apex, we can run this code periodically (though it’s more useful for data-processing logic than arithmetic).

Q: How would you write test cases for this class?
A: By creating a test class with @isTest annotation, and writing unit tests for all methods using System.assertEquals().

🔹 Bonus Questions
Q: Can we perform the same in Process Builder or Flow?
A: Yes, but with limited arithmetic support. Apex provides more flexibility and power for calculations and validations.

Q: Is Apex only used for backend logic?
A: Primarily yes, but it can be connected to frontend components (LWC/Visualforce) for interactive applications.

Q: What are Apex Classes and how are they different from Triggers?
A: Apex Classes are reusable logic containers; triggers are event-driven scripts attached to objects. Classes are modular and easier to test.

Q: What’s the default access modifier for Apex classes?
A: It’s private if not specified, but for cross-class access or global use, we define it as public.


🔹 1. What is the role of Apex in the Salesforce ecosystem?
A: Apex serves as the server-side programming language on the Salesforce platform. It enables developers to define custom application logic, perform data operations, and automate business processes like validations, workflows, and integrations.

🔹 2. How is Apex different from Java or C++?
A: Apex syntax is similar to Java, but it runs in a multi-tenant cloud environment with strict governor limits. Unlike Java, memory and thread management are abstracted, and it focuses heavily on database interaction and Salesforce object model.

🔹 3. What are some features of Apex?
A: Key features include:

Built-in support for DML and SOQL

Trigger support for automation

Exception handling

Unit testing framework

Object-oriented programming with classes and interfaces

🔹 4. Can Apex be compiled locally?
A: No. Apex code is compiled and executed on Salesforce servers. Developers write the code in Developer Console or VS Code, and it is saved and executed in the cloud.

🔹 5. What is the Apex runtime environment?
A: It is the managed execution environment on Salesforce servers where Apex code runs. It enforces resource usage limits, manages memory, and ensures fair execution across users.

🔹 6. What is the difference between Apex Class and Apex Trigger?
A: An Apex Class is reusable logic that can be called from triggers or UI. An Apex Trigger is event-driven and automatically responds to database events like insert, update, delete.

🔹 7. What is DML in Apex?
A: DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations allow Apex to insert, update, delete, merge, or undelete records in Salesforce. Example: insert accountList;

🔹 8. What is SOQL in Apex?
A: SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language) is used to retrieve records from Salesforce objects (like tables in SQL). Example: SELECT Name FROM Account.

🔹 9. What is a multi-tenant environment in Salesforce?
A: A multi-tenant environment allows multiple customers to share the same infrastructure and codebase securely, with logical separation of data and limits.

🔹 10. What are Apex governor limits? Why do they exist?
A: Governor limits ensure resource fairness in the cloud. They limit usage of CPU time, memory, DML rows, SOQL queries, etc., to prevent one user from affecting others.

🔹 11. What are the different types of collections in Apex?
A: Apex supports:

List (ordered collection)

Set (unique, unordered)

Map (key-value pairs)

🔹 12. What is bulkification in Apex?
A: Bulkification is the process of writing Apex code that handles multiple records efficiently, instead of one at a time. It is required to avoid hitting governor limits.

🔹 13. What is a trigger context variable?
A: These are built-in variables like Trigger.new, Trigger.old used in triggers to access before/after states of records during DML operations.

🔹 14. What is Visualforce and how is it related to Apex?
A: Visualforce is Salesforce's HTML-like markup language for building UIs. It is often paired with Apex controllers to manage data and behavior.

🔹 15. Can Apex interact with external systems?
A: Yes, using HTTP Callouts, Web Services (SOAP/REST), Apex can send/receive data from external APIs.

🔹 16. What is Apex Testing?
A: Apex requires unit tests to validate code before deployment. It uses @isTest methods and tools like Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() for mock execution.

🔹 17. What is the importance of test coverage in Apex?
A: Salesforce requires a minimum of 75% test coverage across Apex classes and triggers for deployment to a production org.

🔹 18. What is an Apex batch class?
A: An Apex batch class processes large volumes of data asynchronously by breaking it into chunks and using the Database.Batchable interface.

🔹 19. What are asynchronous Apex methods?
A: These methods (@future, batch, queueable, schedulable) allow Apex to run code in the background, separate from the main execution thread.

🔹 20. What are some Apex design best practices?
A: Key practices include:

Avoid hardcoding

Use custom labels and metadata

Bulkify logic

Handle exceptions gracefully

Write test classes and keep code modular

🔹 1. What is the difference between declarative and programmatic development in Salesforce?
A:

Declarative: Point-and-click tools (like Process Builder, Flows, Workflows).

Programmatic: Using code (Apex, Lightning Components, Visualforce) for complex custom logic.

🔹 2. What is the Salesforce Object Model?
A:
It consists of Standard and Custom Objects that represent tables in a database. Apex interacts with these using DML and SOQL.

🔹 3. What are the types of Apex methods?
A:

Instance methods (called on an object)

Static methods (called on the class directly)

Test methods (@isTest)

Future methods (@future)

🔹 4. What are Apex classes and objects?
A:
An Apex class is a blueprint for objects that contains variables, constructors, and methods. Objects are created from classes using the new keyword.

🔹 5. What is the default access modifier in Apex?
A:
Private. If no access modifier is mentioned, the method or variable is private by default.

🔹 6. What are data types in Apex?
A:
Apex supports:

Primitive types (Integer, String, Boolean, Double)

sObjects

Collections (List, Set, Map)

Enums and User-defined types

🔹 7. Can you overload methods in Apex?
A:
Yes. Method overloading is supported by changing the number or type of parameters.

🔹 8. What is a trigger event?
A:
It specifies when a trigger should run: before insert, after insert, before update, after delete, etc.

🔹 9. What is a sandbox in Salesforce?
A:
A sandbox is a replica of your production environment used for development, testing, and training without affecting live data.

🔹 10. What is a managed vs unmanaged package?
A:

Managed: Controlled by provider, can’t modify code.

Unmanaged: Full access to code. Used for open-source or custom solutions.

🔹 11. What is Apex Trigger.new and Trigger.old?
A:

Trigger.new: Holds new version of records being inserted/updated.

Trigger.old: Holds previous version of records (before update/delete).

🔹 12. What is a record in Salesforce?
A:
A record is a row in an object (table). It holds data like a customer, contact, or transaction.

🔹 13. What are standard objects in Salesforce?
A:
Predefined objects like Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, etc.

🔹 14. What are custom objects?
A:
Objects created by users for storing custom data (e.g., Student__c, Invoice__c). Always suffixed with __c.

🔹 15. What are Apex exceptions and how are they handled?
A:
Errors at runtime are handled using try-catch-finally blocks to prevent app crashes.
